# SSLang - Semantics Supported Language
I am going to create the Semantics Supported Language (SSLang), which cannot do anything, that current languages cannot. And more importantly, I am going to write about the challenges I encounter, and how I solve them.

## Why
I come from a background in software engineering, where I have learned how to develop software (duh). However, I have not learned about the semantics underlining the languages that I use on a daily basis. This was left to the computer science students. Additionally, I only had a brief encounter with formal proofs, which is another area I would like to learn more about.

I have tried to look read several books and various online resources concerning both semantics and formal proof, but you can only learn so much by reading. Furthermore, it is difficult to use semantics and formal proofs in my daily work, because I simply do not have enough knowledge to apply it.

## What
As mentioned in the very top, I am going to create the Semantics Supported Langauge (SSLang). But I am not actually creating a language (yet), I am just creating the semantics of a language. Once I have defined enough semantics of the language in order for the language to be useful in any sense, I will create the language itself. The language will most likely be interpreted, meaning it will require Java/something else executing it. Programs developed in the language will therefore not be compiled to binaries. Furthermore, I hope to begin a process of code-generation to e.g. C along the way. I have many envisioned ideas, and these are presented in **Grand Ideas**.
So how will I do this? See the next section!

## How
* Define the type Integer
* Define the type Boolean
* Define arithmetic operators: +, -, *, and /.

Furthermore, I will write about the proces
I find the current materiale on semantics available online difficult to understand, and therefore I want to
